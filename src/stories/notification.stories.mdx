<br />

### Basics

<hr />

#### type

There are four types of notification: `info`, `success`, `error` and `warning`.
The supplied type determines the color scheme and icon used.

#### placement

Notifications use position `fixed` and can be placed in six locations: `top-start`,
`top`,
`top-end`,
`bottom-start`,
`bottom` and
`bottom-end`

`placement` is set on the `<Notification.Group>`

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Placement} />
</Canvas>

### Limit

You can cap the number of notifications by setting `limit` e.g. `<Notification.Group limit={1}>`.
Any notifications over the limit will be queued and displayed when an open notification is dismissed.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Limit} />
</Canvas>

### Opening and Closing

<hr />

#### closeBtn

A close button will be enabled by default. Set `<Notification closeBtn={false}>` to remove the button

#### autoDismiss

Is the duration in ms before the notification is dismissed.
The timer will be disabled when the user hovers the notification and restarted when the user "unhovers".
Set to `0` to disable.

#### Callbacks

The `onOpened` and `onClosed` callbacks are fired when the opening/closing animation has completed.

<Alert color="info">
    You should remove notifications from your array using the `onClosed` callback.
</Alert>
