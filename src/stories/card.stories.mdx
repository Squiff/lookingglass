# Cards

A Card is a container suitable for most element types. Cards are split up into multiple subcomponents:

-   `Card` : Parent container that wraps all the content and provides elevation
-   `Card.Content`: provides padding for the card content
-   `Card.Header`
-   `Card.Body`
-   `Card.Img` : A container for images

## Basic

A Basic example of a card with a Header and Body

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Basic} />

Content can be added directly into the card content

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.AdditionalControls} />
</Canvas>

## Image

Images can be added directly into the `Card.Img` component. An appropriate width and height should be set. The image will be scaled to the `Card.Img` container and uses the `object-fit: cover` css prop to deal any aspect ratio discrepencies.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Img} />
