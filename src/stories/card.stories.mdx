# Cards

```js
import Card from 'lookingglass-react/Card';
```

A Card is a container suitable for most element types. Cards are split up into multiple subcomponents:

-   `Card` : Parent container that wraps all the content and provides elevation
-   `Card.Content`: provides padding for the card content
-   `Card.Header`: A Card's Header
-   `Card.Body`: A Card's main body text
-   `Card.Img` : A container for images

## Basic

An example of a basic card with a Header and Body

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Basic} />
</Canvas>

## Additional Components

Additional components can be added directly into the card content

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.AdditionalComponent} />
</Canvas>

## Images

Images can be added using the `Card.Img` subcomponent. This can be used as you would a normal `<img>` tag.

`Card.Img` defaults to 100% width. The CSS property `object-fit: cover` is used to deal any aspect ratio discrepencies
(i.e. when changing the image height).

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Img} />
</Canvas>
