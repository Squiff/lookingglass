```

## Basics

Tabs are broken up into subcomponents:

-   `Tabs.Tab` The clickable tab that will switch between panes
-   `Tabs.Panel` Where the content will be set

These components are linked via a `tabID` prop that ensures the correct pane is activated. The `tabId` **must be unique**.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.AllProps} name="All Props" />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="All Props" />

## Controlled

When the `active` prop is supplied, `Tabs` becomes a **_controlled_** component. This means you can control which tab will be visible by setting `active` to the relevant `tabId` value.

With controlled `Tabs`, the `OnChange` callback will be fired when the tab is clicked. It will pass the `tabId` of the clicked tab.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Controlled} />
</Canvas>

## Scrolling

The navigation section will become scrollable when the tabs overflow their container.
Scroll Right or left using the scroll buttons or Left/Right arrow keys.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Scrolling} />
</Canvas>
