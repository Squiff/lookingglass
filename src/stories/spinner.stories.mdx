# Spinner

<Description of={Spinner} />

```js
import Spinner from 'lookingglass-react/Spinner';
```

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.AllProps} name="All Props" />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="All Props" />

## Sizes

The spinner has three preset sizes

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Sizes} />
</Canvas>

## Halo

You can enable/disable a spinner track by setting `halo` to true or false.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Halo} />
</Canvas>

## Custom Styles

Custom styles can be applied to spinners by setting color, width and height styles.

Note that when setting a size, you should still use the size prop to get the most appropiate stroke width to size ratio
i.e. larger spinners should use `size="l"`

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Styled} />
</Canvas>

Using Color Utilities

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Colors} />
</Canvas>

## Delay

It can sometimes be benificial to delay showing a loading spinner.
For example, if you have a request that typically resolves
quickly, you may not want to show a flash of the spinner followed by the content.

In these circumstances you can set the `delay` prop to only show the spinner after a selected timeout.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Delay} />
</Canvas>
