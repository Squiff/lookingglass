## Basics

A `Drawer` can contain any type of content. It is positioned out of view until `show` is set to true.
When set to true, the drawer will slide into view from the specified `direction`.

When a `drawer` is active:

-   An overlay will be enabled to prevent clicking
-   The window's scrollbar will be removed
-   Focus will be scoped to the drawer content

#### Sizing

Width, height and overflow are set according to direction:

-   Left and right drawers will size to their content's width
-   Top and bottom drawers will size to their content's height
-   Left and right have `overflow-y: auto`
-   Top and Bottom have `overflow-x: auto`

## Closing

A drawer can be closed by setting `show={false}`

An `onClose` callback should be provided. This allows the `Drawer` to close when:

-   The `ESC` key is pressed
-   The overlay is clicked

The `ESC` key is mandatory, but you can prevent an overlay click triggering
`onClose` by setting `closeOnClick={false}` - This is set to false in the example below.
