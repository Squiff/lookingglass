## Sizing

A `Carousel` is a block element, so will expand to the maximum available width and it's height is determined by
the height of the slides. To prevent height changes when transitioning between slides you should either:

1. Set a height on the `Carousel` using `className` or `style` props
2. Set all slide contents to be a consistant height

## Controls

Carousel controls can be configured to control visibility and color scheme.

#### Buttons

Previous and next buttons are visible by default. These can be hidden by setting `buttonVisibility="hidden"`
or only shown on hover using `buttonVisibility="hover"`

#### Indicators

Indicator "Dot" controls can be added to the bottom of the Carousel by setting `indicators={true}`.
Each Indicator can be clicked to go directly to the relative slide.

#### Colors

The Buttons and Indicators use a light them by default. This can be changed to dark by setting `controlColor="dark"`

## Auto Run

The Carousel can be set to automatically slide on an interval using the `autoCycle` prop.
For example, setting `autoCycle="2000"` will move to the next slide every 2 seconds

    <Story story={stories.AutoCycle} />

## Callbacks

Callbacks are fired when a new slide is initially selected and when the slide animation is completed.
The Callbacks will be passed the selected slide.
