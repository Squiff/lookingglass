# Utilities

CSS comes equipped with a set of utility classes for setting various CSS properties.
A utility component, `<CSS>` is available to generate these class names. Let's see how it works.

## CSS

```js
import CSS from 'lookingglass-react/CSS';
```

The `<CSS>` component will generate a set of classes based on the passed properties.

-   The classes generated by `<CSS>` will be added to the child component
-   Classes will be merged with the `ClassName` on the child
-   By default `<CSS>` expects there to be **exactly one child**.

Note that this is accomplished by setting the `className` prop, so If you are passing classes to a React component
(opposed to an HTML element) then you will need to handle the `className` that is being passed.

In this example we set backgroundColor, color, padding and borderRadius - All classes are then passed to the child `<div>`

<Canvas>
    <CSS backgroundColor="primary" color="white" padding="3" borderRadius="2">
        <div className="childclass">
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Maiores non molestias porro
            quia reiciendis doloremque!
        </div>
    </CSS>
</Canvas>

## Create Wrapper

By setting `<CSS div={true}>` you tell `<CSS>` to generate its own `<div>` element.

-   Classes will be added to the generated `<div>`
-   Children are placed directly into the new node
-   This removes the requirement of only being able to specify a single child.

<Canvas>
    <CSS div backgroundColor="primary" color="white" padding="3" borderRadius="2">
        <h5>Heading 1</h5>
        <h5>Heading 2</h5>
        <h5>Heading 3</h5>
        <h5>Heading 4</h5>
    </CSS>
</Canvas>

## Props

The stories in the Utilities section use the `<CSS>` component and further detail the expected values for each property.
