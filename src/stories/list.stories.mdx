<Description of={List} />

### Standard

A `List` represent an unordered list with `margin` and `padding` removed and has no list style.

A List is made up of `List.Item` components, which add spacing to their children.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Standard} />
</Canvas>

### Links and buttons

The List component is particularly useful when used as a navigation tool. Any `<a>` or `<button>`
elements added directly in a `List.Item` will be styled as a list item, but with a hover effect added.

Lists like this can be combined with `<Drawers>` to create a a sliding side menu or in `<NavBar>` dropdowns.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.NavList} />
</Canvas>

#### Divider

Adding a divider as above is achieved by wrapping an `<hr/>` in a `<div>`

```html
<div>
    <hr />
</div>
```
