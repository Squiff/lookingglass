## Basics

-   Flexbox is implemented with two components `Flex` and `Flex.Child`.
-   Any value applied to `Flex` will be applied to all children unless overridden on `Flex.Child`
-   A flex item can be given a `col` value of `Auto`, `Equal` or numbers `1 - 12`

`Equal`: Space is shared equally amongst all children set as `Auto`. This is the default for `Flex` if nothing is specified.

`Auto` : The item will only take up the neccessary space to fit it's content

`1 - 12 Flex`: will create a 'grid' with this many columns. This is done by giving children a width of `100%/#columns`

`1 - 12 Flex.Child`: A numeric value based on a 12 column row. so `col="12"` is 100% width, `col="9"` is 75% width, `col="4"` is 33% width

-   `Flex` will wrap when content is to large
-   Responsive classes are provided for layouts at different breakpoints

## Flex Examples

#### Equal Width

All columns are equal width by default

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Equal} />
</Canvas>

#### Set Columns

Setting `cols="2"` on `Flex` will create a 'grid' of two columns

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Columns} />
</Canvas>

#### Auto

Setting `cols="Auto"` on `Flex` will tell all children to only take up the neccessary space. Use along with Justify to center the content.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Auto} />
</Canvas>

#### Responsive

`Flex` also allows responsive layouts. This is accomplished by setting the value of `col` to an object of shape `{[breakpoint] : [Value]}`.

Below we have set `{s: "1", m: "equal"}`, which means at the small breakpoint the 'grid' will be 1 column wide, but will change at the medium breakpoint to be equal columns.

Note that values are applied for the specified breakpoint **upwards**

</Canvas>

## Flex Child Examples

#### Set Flex Child Columns

Any value applied to `Flex` will be applied to all children unless overridden on `Flex.Child`. Here `Flex cols="1"` so all children default to 100% wide, except Child 2 `Flex.Child cols="8"` and Child 3 `Flex.Child cols="4"`

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.ChildrenColumns} />
</Canvas>

#### Responsive Child

As with `Flex`, `Flex.Child` can also accept a `cols` of shape `{[breakpoint] : [Value]}`.

Here we have set

-   `Flex` to be `col="1"`
-   Child 2 to be `col={{m:'6'}}`
-   Child 3 to be `col={{m:'6'}}`

This means all columns default to 100%. At the medium breakpoint Child 2 and Child 3 will become 6 columns wide
