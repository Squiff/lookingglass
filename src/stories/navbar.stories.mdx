## Summary

Throughout this section we will see different ways we can setup a `NavBar`.
First let's cover the main style properties of a nav bar:

-   `display: flex`
-   `justify-content: space-between` for easy spacing of children
-   `align-items: center` for vertical alignment of children
-   `padding` on the left and right to prevent children being pushed directly to the edges

### Sub Components

A `NavBar` is comprised of several subcomponents

-   `NavBar.Nav` - This is the main `<nav>` element that should wrap the list of links
-   `NavBar.NavItem` - is an individual link or button that makes up part of the main `<nav>`.
    They should be children of `NavBar.Nav`
-   `NavBar.Dropdown` Contains dropdown content such as additional links or login forms.
-   `NavBar.Tray` is a full width dropdown that slides down from the navbar. It can contain most content types.

### Other Components

You are not restricted to only using the above sub components.
Useful components to combine with `NavBar` include:

-   **Breakpoints** - Hide or show content at certain breakpoints using the `<Lookingglass display={...} ..>` utility
-   **Color** - Add color to `NavBar` using the `className` prop or the `<Lookingglass backgroundColor="..." ..>` utility
-   **Lists** - use the `<List>` component to give structure to dropdown content
-   **Drawers** - Add a `<Drawer>` for small screens to display navigation links
-   **Buttons** - The `<Button>` component provides an unstyled variation with configurable hover effects that make it ideal for use in a navbar

## Color

By default a `NavBar` will have no distinctive colors applied.
Apply colors by setting `className`, `style` or using the `<Lookingglass>` Utility.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Color} />
</Canvas>

## Spacing and Breakpoints

`NavBar` has `display: flex` and `justify-content: space-between` so content is spaced evenly.
Here the NavBar has two children, The logo and `NavBar.Nav`, which get pushed to oposite ends of the `NavBar`.

You can control the spacing using the margin utilities

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Spacing} />
</Canvas>

### Breakpoints

Hide and show content at a specified breakpoint using the `<Lookingglass display={...} ..>` utility

Here we hide the navigation links at the small breakpoint and show them from the medium breakpoint. We will use the same technique when we look at using `<Drawers>`

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Breakpoints} />
</Canvas>

## Buttons

use `<Button btnStyle="none" ...>` as a utility button. You can set `hoverEffect` for an appropriate hover style for your background choice.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Buttons} />
</Canvas>

## Dropdowns

Use `Nav.Dropdown` to add dropdown content.
It has been built using the `<Popup>` component and simply adds a few basic styles on top of it.

#### Popup Summary

Any props `Nav.Dropdown` receives are passed onto `<Popup>` - You can read more in depth about `<Popup>` in the docs, but for the application of a simple dropdown here's what you should know:

-   The dropdown needs to be passed a `targetRef` so it knows which element it needs to position itself below.
    This will commonly be the button that triggers the dropdown to show.
-   set `show={true}` to show the dropdown and `show={false}` to hide it.
-   pass an `onClose` callback, which the dropdown will trigger when it wants to close (i.e. when the user clicks away or presses ESC)

#### Lists

Use a `<List>` to create a simple navigation dropdown. This provides the styling for lists of items as well as hover effects for `<a>` and `<button>` elements.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Dropdown} />
</Canvas>

#### Other Dropdown Content

Dropdowns are not limited to lists. They can contain any content, such as a login form.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.DropdownLogin} />
</Canvas>

## Navigation Tray

A tray is a full width dropdown that slides out from the NavBar.
It can contain any type of content such as navigation options that cannot fit on the main `NavBar`.

### Tray Props

`Navbar.Tray` exposes the following props:

| Prop      | Data Type | Description                                                                    |
| :-------- | :-------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| show      |   bool    | show or hide the tray                                                          |
| onClose   |   Func    | callback fired when the Tray wants to close                                    |
| onClosed  |   Func    | callback fired when the close transition is complete                           |
| onOpened  |   Func    | callback fired when the open transition is complete                            |
| clickAway |   bool    | Run the onClose Callback when user clicks away from the tray. Defaults to True |
| escape    |   bool    | Run the onClose Callback when user hits escape. Defaults to True               |

### Tray Styles

The Tray only comes with very basic styling out of the box.
Use the `className` prop or `<Lookingglass>` utility to apply further styles.

In the below example we have setup the "Open Tray" button to toggle the `show` prop.

The contents of the `<Nav.Tray>` is a set of Cards (but the content could be anything you like!).
They have been wrapped in `<Lookingglass padding="2" backgroundColor="primary-d1">` to provide padding
and a background color.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Tray} />

## Drawers

You may choose to put your navigation links in a `<Drawer>` after a certain breakpoint.
This is a simple setup when using the display utility.
If you are unfamiliar with `<Drawer>`, then you can read the docs [here](/?path=/story/drawers--all-props)

#### Responsive Drawer

1. Wrap `NavBar.Nav` in a div with a display value of `{s: 'none', m:'block'}`.
   This will hide the navigation on the navbar at the small breakpoint, but show it on the medium breakpoint upwards.

2. Give the drawer button a display value of `{s: 'block', m:'none'}`.
   This will show the button at the small breakpoint, but hide it on medium upwards.

3. Add a `<List>` into `<Drawer>`. This should contain the same Links as `NavBar.Nav`
