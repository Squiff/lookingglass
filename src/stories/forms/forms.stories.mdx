# Forms

A variety of components used for building forms. Including inputs, selects, spacing and styled text

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Form} />
</Canvas>

## Summary

`Input`, `Select`, `TextArea`, `Label` are the main components and are styled wrappers around their standard HTML counterparts.
All props are passed on, so you can make use of these components as you would the standard elements.

`Input`, `Select`, `TextArea` are all `display: block` by default, but this can be changed using the `inline` prop

#### FormGroup

A `<FormGroup>` component is used to provide a `margin-bottom` and controls the spacing between fields. You will see it in the examples throughout this section.

#### Submit

No special styling has been provided for `type="submit"`. It is recommended to use the `<Button>` component for better control of styling.

## Input Properties

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.AllProps} name="All Props" />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="All Props" />

## States

Styling is provided for read only and disabled fields.

-   Disabled fields are greyed out and cannot be interacted with
-   Read Only fields have a greyed border, but can still be focused, however the value cannot be changed

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.States} />
</Canvas>

## Validation

Setting `invalid` on an input will apply a red border

The `<InputValidation>` component is provided to show any related error messages.
Note how they are all in the same `<FormGroup>` for correct spacing.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Validation} />
</Canvas>

The `:invalid` pseudo selector will also be given the same styles

## Sizes

Set the `size` prop to modify the field size

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Sizes} />
</Canvas>

## Selects

`Selects` use the same props as the `Input` component - except that a `select` does not have a `readonly` attribute.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Selects} />
</Canvas>

## Text Area

As with `Select`, the `TextArea` component uses the same props as `Input`.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.TextAreas} />
</Canvas>

## Help Text

`InputHelp` is available for displaying helpful messages next to the field.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.HelpText} />
</Canvas>

## Miscellaneous Input Types

A preview of other input types

<Canvas>
