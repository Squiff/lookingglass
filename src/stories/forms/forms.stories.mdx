# Forms

A variety of components used for building forms. Including inputs, selects, spacing and styled text

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Form} />
</Canvas>

## Summary

`Input`, `Select`, `TextArea` and `Label` are the main components that make up a form. These components are styled wrappers around their standard HTML counterparts.
All props are passed on, so you can make use of these components as you would the standard elements.

`Input`, `Select`, `TextArea` all default to `display: block`. This can be changed using the `inline` prop

#### FormGroup

A `<FormGroup>` component is used to provide a `margin-bottom` and controls the spacing between fields. You will see it in the examples throughout this section.

#### Submit

No special styling has been provided for `type="submit"`. It is recommended to use the `<Button>` component for better control of styling.

## Input Properties

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.AllProps} name="All Props" />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="All Props" />

## States

Styling is provided for read only and disabled fields.

-   Disabled fields are greyed out and cannot be interacted with
-   Read Only fields have a dulled border. The value cannot be changed, but the field can be focused.
-   Setting `<Label disabled>` will add opacity to the label

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.States} />
</Canvas>

## Validation

Validation styles are available for highlighting the field that has an issue and displaying any error information.

-   Setting `<Input invalid>` will apply an error border to the field
-   Setting `<Label invalid>` will apply an error color to the label
-   The `<InputValidation>` component is provided to show any related error messages.
    Note how they are all in the same `<FormGroup>` for correct spacing.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Validation} />
</Canvas>

`Inputs` matching the `:invalid` pseudo selector will also be given the same styles as the `<Input invalid>` prop.

## Sizes

Set the `size` prop to modify the field size

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Sizes} />
</Canvas>

## Checkboxes and Radios

Checkboxes and Radios will display inline. They have a `margin-right` applied by default for inline spacing.

If you want to place them on separate lines, they can be wrapped in a `<FormGroup>`.

#### Checkboxes

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Checkbox} />
</Canvas>

#### Radios

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Radio} />
</Canvas>

## Selects

`Selects` use the same props as the `Input` component - except that a `select` does not have a `readonly` attribute.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Selects} />
</Canvas>

## Text Area

As with `Select`, the `TextArea` component uses the same props as `Input`.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.TextAreas} />
</Canvas>

## Help Text

`InputHelp` will display a helpful messages below the field.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.HelpText} />
</Canvas>

## Miscellaneous Input Types

<Canvas>
