# Global Styles

The following reset should be defined in order for component sizing to work as expected. This has already been included in the main SASS entry point.
You will need to include this in your style if you are not using all styles.

```css
*,
*::before,
*::after {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

## Lists

Lists use the following global styles.

```css
ol,
ul {
    margin-top: 0;
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
    padding-left: 2rem;
}
```
