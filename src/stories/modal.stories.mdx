## Basics

A Modal will become visible when `show` is set to true. It will be positioned in the center of the screen.

When a modal is active:

-   An overlay will be enabled to prevent clicking outside
-   The window's Scrollbar will be removed
-   Focus will be scoped to the modal content

## Closing

A Modal can be closed by setting `show={false}`

An `onClose` callback should be provided. This is triggered by the `Modal` when:

-   The `ESC` key is pressed
-   The overlay is clicked

Set `closeOnClick = {false}` to prevent the `onClose` callback triggering on an overlay click.

## Sizing

A good way to size a modal is by setting a `max-width` that is appropriate for the modal's content.
This ensures:

1. It is limited to `max-width` on larger viewports.
2. The Modal can take up the full width when screen size is smaller than `max width`.
