# Modals

<Description of={Modal} />

## Basics
A Modal will become visible when `show = true`. During it's opening and closing Transitions it will fire the following callback:

- `onClose`: When closing first starts
- `onClosed`: When closing is finished
- `onOpened`: When opening transition starts

Modals will be centered and should be sized using the sizing utilities (i.e. 50vw for half width )

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.AllProps} name="All Props" />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="All Props" />
