# Theming

<hr />

You can customize your project's color pallete, breakpoints or individual components by using configurable Sass variables.
Read more on the `@use ... with ...` syntax [here](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use).

### Sass Imports with @use

The main config file is located at `lookingglass-react/sass/components/_config.scss`
This holds high level variables such as **breakpoints** and **theme colors**.

Components styles are located in `lookingglass-react/sass/components`
and contain customizable variables for individual components e.g. `lookingglass-react/sass/components/_alert.scss`
for `<Alert>` styles.

## Config Example

This shows how you could change the theme colors from the config file.

```scss
@use 'lookingglass-react/sass/components/config' with (
    $theme: (
        'primary': #FF69B4,
        'success': #1b881f,
        'error': #dd2b0e,
        'warning': #f5b700,
        'info': #1d77d1,
    )
);
```

**Note that the config file should be imported before any imports**

## Component Example

This shows hows you could alter the default `<Alert>` styles

```scss
@use 'lookingglass-react/sass/components/alerts' with (
    $padding: 0.25rem,
    $font-size: 1rem,
    $header-font-size: 1rem,
    $border-radius: 0.25rem
);
```
