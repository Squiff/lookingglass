# Lookingglass

<hr />

<Lookingglass div fontSize="1" marginBottom="5">
    Lookingglass is a UI component library built with React and styled in Sass.
</Lookingglass>

## Getting Started

Install the npm package below into your project,
which contains everything you need to get started.

```
    npm install lookingglass-react
```

#### Using Components

You can use a component by using an import in the below format.
If you are unsure of the import you need, then visit the component's main page

```js
import Alert from 'lookingglass-react/Alert';
```

#### Importing Styles

In order to setup the stylesheet, you will need Sass configured in your project.
To apply all styles, from your Sass file you can `@use` the below entry point.

```scss
@use 'lookingglass-react/sass/index';
```

Or if you are only using a few components, only import the styles you are using

```scss
@use 'lookingglass-react/sass/components/alerts';
```

#### Global Styles

The following reset should be defined in order for component sizing to work as expected.
This has already been included in the main SASS entry point.
You will need to include this in your stylesheet if you are not using all styles.

```css
*,
*::before,
*::after {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
