# Typography

This page details global typography styles that are included in the main Sass entry point.

The following system font stack is set on the `<body>`

```css
font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell,
    'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;
```

## Headers

Headings `<h1>` through `<h6>`. Headers will dynamically resize base on the screen width to prevent larger headings taking up too much space on smaller screens.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Headers} />
</Canvas>

## Standard Text

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Paragraph} />
</Canvas>

## Sass Imports

If not using the main Sass entry point, you can include typography styles in Sass

```scss
@use 'lookingglass-react/sass/components/Typography';
```
